# Population

Population refers to the total set of observations that can be made.
 
## For example
  - if we are studying the weight of adult women, the population is the set of weights of all the women in the world.


# Sampling

Sampling is the subset of the population in which a predetermined number of observations are taken from a larger population.

- ## Simple Random Sampling:
`Every element has an equal chance of getting selected to be the part sample. It is used when we don’t have any kind of prior information about the target population`

## For Example

-  Random selection of 20 students from class of 50 student. Each student has equal chance of getting selected. Here probability of selection is 1/50.

- ## Stratified Sampling:
`This technique divides the elements of the population into small subgroups (strata) based on the similarity in such a way that the elements within the group are homogeneous and heterogeneous among the other subgroups formed. And then the elements are randomly selected from each of these strata. We need to have prior information about the population to create subgroups`

## For Example

- Suppose a research team wants to determine the GPA of college students across the U.S. The research team has difficulty collecting data from all 21 million college students; it decides to take a random sample of the population by using 4,000 students.

- Now assume that the team looks at the different attributes of the sample participants and wonders if there are any differences in GPAs and students’ majors. Suppose it finds that 560 students are English majors, 1,135 are science majors, 800 are computer science majors, 1,090 are engineering majors, and 415 are math majors. The team wants to use a proportional stratified random sample where the stratum of the sample is proportional to the random sample in the population.

- Assume the team researches the demographics of college students in the U.S and finds the percentage of what students major in 12% major in English, 28% major in science, 24% major in computer science, 21% major in engineering, and 15% major in mathematics. Thus, five strata are created from the stratified random sampling process.

- The team then needs to confirm that the stratum of the population is in proportion to the stratum in the sample; however, they find the proportions are not equal. The team then needs to resample 4,000 students from the population and randomly select 480 English, 1,120 science, 960 computer science, 840 engineering, and 600 mathematics students. With those, it has a proportionate stratified random sample of college students, which provides a better representation of students' college majors in the U.S. The researchers can then highlight specific stratum, observe the varying studies of U.S. college students and observe the various grade point averages. 


- ## Systemic Sampling:
`Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling method in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.`

## For Example

- if you wanted to select a random group of 1,000 people from a population of 50,000 using systematic sampling, all the potential participants must be placed in a list and a starting point would be selected. Once the list is formed, every 50th person on the list (starting the count at the selected starting point) would be chosen as a participant, since 50,000/1,000 = 50.

- For example, if the selected starting point was 20, the 70th person on the list would be chosen followed by the 120th, and so on. Once the end of the list was reached and if additional participants are required, the count loops to the beginning of the list to finish the count. 

## Cluster Sampling
`Our entire population is divided into clusters or sections and then the clusters are randomly selected. All the elements of the cluster are used for sampling. Clusters are identified using details such as age, sex, location etc.`
